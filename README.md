## How to use DPC Miner

There are two ways you can use the DPC Miner on the data

###### Use the trained RL-Model

You can use the already trained RL-Model on DPC Miner to mine for more data using DPC_Miner.Py

- Place the file you want to mine as "read_miner"
- Place the address of labelled dataset as "read_classifier_data"
- Load the trained RL_Model
- Train the DPC_Miner
- Get the mining Prediction

###### Train both RL_Model and DPC_Miner
